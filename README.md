# preceptron_v_module
A V module to use multi-layer neural networks. Includes backpropagation but you can train them the way you want. If you have any questions or suggestions I'd be happy to read them !

An example can be found in example.v (I think it covers nearly the whole module but if you have any question, dont mind asking me).
If you run the file it will train a small neural network with backpropagation to make it learn a XOR logic gate.

The number of layer in the neural network is ajustable with the nb_neurons field by using it like that : '[number of inputs, number of neurons of the first hidden layer, insert as many hidden layers as you want, number of outputs]'
