This is a V module to create neural networks. (there is also a gui module named `ggui` that I used for the mnist example)

For the moment there is two examples, the XOR logic gate example and the MNIST example.
Here is a screenshot from the MNIST example tester `examples/mnist_tester.v` (it needs to be launched into the examples folder to have the right path to load the neural network save):

Here is the new documentation that just started: https://eliyaan.github.io/NeuralNetworks-V-Module/

I hope you enjoy your time with it, if you have any question dont mind asking me here or on discord! There is still a lot to be worked on for the module to be entirely complete!
